    Content: Hello, this is Jonathan. I'm using a blog to keep track of my learning notes throughout my career. I find almost all fields in software development quite fascinating, however I plan on specializing in database/cloud system scaling and system design. I want to give all the credit to Lilian Weng (very incredible researcher) for being the source of inspiration for this blog.
