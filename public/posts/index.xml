      <description>Introduction At this point in time, I am a software engineer intern at a blockchain company located in Toronto, working on implementing bitcoin smart contracts in a digital wallet. I have been confused over the past few years about what I would do in the future, so I think a little bit of background would help. Feel free to skip the next section!
Some Background I am currently studying computer science at the University of Western Ontario.</description>
